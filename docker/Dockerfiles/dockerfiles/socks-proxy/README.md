# Simple SSH Server for SOCKS proxy

SSH server specifically designed for use as a socks proxy while attached to a
VPN container's network.

- Default user is `proxy`. Root login is disabled.
- Password authentication disabled.
- Public key is injected into image at build time (and a different username if
  desired).
- The desired port needs to be published _on the VPN container, not when running
  this container!_ This is because we are using the network for the VPN
  container so it controls the port assignments.

## Build

The public key and username(optional) need to be defined and are copied into the
image at build time. The default username is `proxy`, so SSHD_USER can be
skipped if desired.

    docker build -t socks-proxy \
                 --build-arg PUB_KEY=$(cat <path/to/id_ed25519.pub>) \
                 --build-arg SSHD_USER=firecat53 .

## Run

    docker run -d --net container:wireguard-client_run --name socks-proxy_run socks-proxy

## Example Usage

    ssh -fND 5000 -i .ssh/id_ed25519 -p 2222 proxy@localhost
