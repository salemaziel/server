DIR="${BASH_SOURCE%/*}"
if [[ ! -d "$DIR" ]]; then DIR="$PWD"; fi
. "$DIR/incl.sh"
. "$DIR/main.sh"

. (dot) command is an alias to source, $PWD is the Path for the Working Directory, BASH_SOURCE is an array variable whose members are the source filenames, ${string%substring} strips shortest match of $substring from back of $string

I think the best way to do this is to use the Chris Boran's way, BUT you should compute MY_DIR this way:

#!/bin/sh
MY_DIR=$(dirname $(readlink -f $0))
$MY_DIR/other_script.sh

To quote the man pages for readlink:

    readlink - display value of a symbolic link

    ...

      -f, --canonicalize
            canonicalize  by following every symlink in every component of the given 
            name recursively; all but the last component must exist
