# NGINX max clients formula



# max clients = worker_connections * worker_processes
# Should be equal to `ulimit -n / nrpoc`
echo $(($(ulimit -n) / $(nproc)))




This useful bash snippet contains a formula that is used to find out how many worker_connections and worker_proccesses to set in your NGINX configuration.

nproc returns your core count and is used to find out how many worker_processes you should have, 1 per core.

ulimit reports the file size writing limit for your shell and child processes, which when divided by your cores gives you the max worker connections.
