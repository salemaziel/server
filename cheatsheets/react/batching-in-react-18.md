React Batching in React v18


function myApp() {
  const [buttonOne, setButtonOne] = useState('green');
  const [buttonTwo, setButtonTwo] = useState('Orange');
  const [buttonThree, setButtonThree] = useState('pink');

  function changeColorToWhite(){
    setButtonOne('white'); //NOT YET
    setButtonTwo('white');  // NOT YET
    setButtonThree('white')
    //Now rerender
  }

  return(
      <>
    <MyButton onClick={changeColorToWhite}></MyButton>
    </>
  )
}





Batching refers to the process combining a few state update events and sending them wit just 1 call to update the DOM.

BETA Snippet explanation automatically generated by OpenAI:
Here is what the above code is doing:
1. We have set the state to a variable called buttonOne, buttonTwo, and buttonThree.
2. We have created a function called changeColorToWhite that will change the button state to white.
3. We have called the changeColorToWhite function when the button is clicked.
